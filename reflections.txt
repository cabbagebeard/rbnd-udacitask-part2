# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
  I used the terminal-table because it was easy to employ and it made the lists easier on the eyes.
  
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) delete_by_type: 
    Sometimes it's nice to blow off all your priorities at once. Got a bunch of events coming up that you just don't feel like going to? Blow them all off in one swift move.
  b) change_priority:
    You never know when something is going to become more or less of a priority. A todo list should be as flexible as you are.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project? 
  Maybe 3 hours?
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  Finally deciding upon a gem after a bit of reading and trial/error.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why? 
  Stated above
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  My code still looks/feels sloppy.
